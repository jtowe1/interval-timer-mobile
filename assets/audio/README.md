# Audio Assets

This directory contains audio files for the interval timer app.

## Files needed:
- chime.mp3 - Timer completion sound
- beep.wav - Simple beep sound

## Note:
You can add your own audio files here. Common formats supported:
- MP3
- WAV
- M4A

For now, the app will use expo-audio's programmatic sound generation or fallback to haptic feedback.
